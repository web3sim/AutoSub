# AutoSub Architecture

This document explains the technical architecture of AutoSub.

## Overview

AutoSub is a decentralized subscription protocol built on Massa Network that enables:

- **On-chain subscription management**
- **Automated recurring payments** 
- **Transparent billing cycles**
- **Creator monetization tools**

## System Components

### 1. Smart Contract Layer

**Technology:** AssemblyScript on Massa Network

**Responsibilities:**
- Store subscription plans and user subscriptions
- Handle payment processing logic
- Schedule recurring payments via deferred calls
- Emit events for off-chain tracking
- Manage access controls and authorization

**Key Features:**
- Gas-efficient storage patterns
- Automated payment execution
- Flexible billing intervals
- Multi-token support (extensible)

### 2. Frontend Application

**Technology:** React + TypeScript + Vite

**Responsibilities:**
- User interface for plan creation and subscription
- Wallet integration for transaction signing
- Real-time subscription status updates
- Payment history and analytics

**Key Features:**
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Web3 wallet integration
- Real-time updates via blockchain events
- Intuitive subscription management

### 3. Deployment Scripts

**Technology:** Node.js + Massa Web3 SDK

**Responsibilities:**
- Smart contract compilation and deployment
- Environment configuration
- Network connectivity verification
- Contract address management

## Data Flow

### Plan Creation Flow

```
Creator → Frontend → Smart Contract → Storage
                 ↓
              Event Emission → Frontend Update
```

1. Creator fills plan creation form
2. Frontend validates input data
3. Transaction sent to smart contract
4. Contract stores plan data on-chain
5. Event emitted for frontend updates
6. Plan becomes available for subscription

### Subscription Flow

```
User → Frontend → Smart Contract → Deferred Call Scheduler
                            ↓
                     Payment Execution (Automated)
```

1. User browses available plans
2. User initiates subscription
3. Contract creates subscription record
4. First payment processed immediately
5. Deferred call scheduled for next payment
6. Automated payments continue until cancellation

### Payment Execution Flow

```
Massa Network → Deferred Call → executePayment() → Token Transfer
                                       ↓
                               Schedule Next Payment
```

1. Network triggers deferred call at scheduled time
2. `executePayment()` function executes
3. Tokens transferred from subscriber to creator
4. Next payment automatically scheduled
5. Subscription record updated

## Storage Architecture

### Storage Keys

```
plan_count          → u64 (total plans)
subscription_count  → u64 (total subscriptions)
plan_{id}          → Plan JSON
subscription_{id}  → Subscription JSON
user_subs_{addr}   → Subscription ID list
```

### Data Optimization

- **JSON Serialization**: Efficient data storage
- **Indexed Access**: Fast lookups by ID
- **Batch Operations**: Minimize storage calls
- **Event Logging**: Off-chain data aggregation

## Security Model

### Access Controls

- **Plan Management**: Only creators can modify their plans
- **Subscription Control**: Subscribers and creators can cancel
- **Payment Execution**: Only contract can execute payments
- **Admin Functions**: No admin privileges (fully decentralized)

### Payment Security

- **Atomic Operations**: All-or-nothing payment processing
- **Balance Validation**: Ensure sufficient funds before processing
- **Error Recovery**: Handle failed payments gracefully
- **Replay Protection**: Prevent duplicate payment execution

### Smart Contract Security

- **Input Validation**: All parameters validated
- **Overflow Protection**: Safe arithmetic operations
- **State Consistency**: Atomic state updates
- **Event Integrity**: Consistent event emission

## Scalability Considerations

### On-Chain Efficiency

- **Storage Optimization**: Minimal on-chain data
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient function implementations
- **Batch Processing**: Group operations where possible
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Off-chain data aggregation

### Network Performance

- **Deferred Calls**: Distributed payment processing
- **Read Optimization**: Efficient data retrieval patterns
- **Caching Strategy**: Frontend data caching
- **Progressive Loading**: Lazy data loading

## Integration Points

### Wallet Integration

- **Massa Station**: Primary wallet support
- **Web3 Standards**: Standard transaction interfaces
- **Multi-Wallet**: Extensible wallet support
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Mobile wallet integration

### External Services

- **Event Indexing**: Off-chain event processing
- **Analytics**: Subscription metrics tracking
- **Notifications**: Payment and subscription alerts
- **APIs**: RESTful API for integrations

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment

```
Local Development → Massa Testnet → Production Deployment
      ↓                   ↓                    ↓
   Mock Data        Test Contracts      Live Contracts
   Local UI         Staging UI          Production UI
```

### Infrastructure

- **Smart Contracts**: Deployed on Massa Network
- **Frontend**: Static hosting (Vercel/Netlify)
- **APIs**: Optional backend services for analytics
- **Monitoring**: Contract and UI monitoring

## Future Enhancements

### Technical Roadmap

1. **Multi-Token Support**: ERC20-like token integration
2. **Advanced Billing**: Tiered pricing, discounts
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Creator insights and metrics
4. **Mobile App**: Native mobile applications
5. **Integration APIs**: Third-party service integration

### Scalability Improvements

1. **Layer 2 Integration**: Cross-chain subscriptions
2. **State Channels**: Off-chain micro-payments
3. **Indexing Service**: Advanced query capabilities
4. **Caching Layer**: Improved performance
5. **API Gateway**: Rate limiting and optimization
